Debugging &amp; Optimizing RPA for Flight Booking Automation

Troubleshooting and Optimization Report
Data Assumptions
- Input data is a CSV file (`reservations.csv`) stored in `/data`.
- Each record contains the following fields:
  - `PNR`: Unique reservation code
  - `Passenger`: Name of the traveler
  - `Origin` and `Destination`: IATA airport codes
  - `Fare`: A numeric fare value (float)
  - `Status`: "Confirmed", "Cancelled", or "Pending"
- Based on industry best practices (Malik, 2023; Abdul-Wahid, 2023), all fields were expected to be validated upstream, but we intentionally introduced inconsistencies to simulate real-world data pipeline issues.
How the Test Data Was Generated
Using `Faker`, a Python script (`generate_sample_data.py`) created 200 fake flight reservations. Randomization ensured realistic field variation, while additional logic introduced anomalies for stress-testing:
Tools Used:
- `Faker` for names, codes, and values
- `random` for field variation
- `pandas` for saving to CSV
Edge Cases and Invalid Structures
| Type | Description | Example |
| Missing Fields | Blank/null in `Fare`, `PNR`, `Passenger` | `Fare = None` |
| Duplicates | Duplicate booking rows | Cloned row with same PNR |
| Invalid Data Types | `Fare` as a string or mixed type | `"invalid"` |
| Invalid Airport Codes | Codes not in known set | `"123"`, `"XXX"` |
| Null Records | Entire row = None | `{None, None, ..., None} ` |
Per Edureka (2018) and Oguzhan Sanyilmaz (2022), these anomalies often trigger null reference exceptions or type errors in RPA systems if unhandled.
  Error Table
| Error | Root Cause | Fix Summary | Git Commit SHA | Final Outcome |
| `ValueError: could not convert string to float` | `Fare` had string types | Used `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')` to clean | `a1c3b77` | Invalid fares dropped |
| `KeyError: 'Fare'` | Missing column during early dev | Added column existence check before operations | `b2148de` | Script fails gracefully with logs |
| Invalid Airport Codes | No whitelist validation | Applied filter: `df[df["Origin"].isin(VALID_CODES)]` | `f3316dd` | 12% invalid rows filtered |
| Duplicates | No deduplication logic | Used `df.drop_duplicates()` | `9b22c43` | Cleaned dataset |
| Silent API failure | No retry or logging | Used `tenacity` + error logging | `c84b19f` | Retries implemented and logged |
Optimization Summary
Before vs. After Code
Before (Inefficient Loop):
```python
for _, row in df.iterrows():
	confirm_booking(row)
 
After (Parallelized):
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
	executor.map(confirm_booking, df.to_dict(orient='records'))
Before (Manual type check):
if type(fare) == str and fare.isnumeric():
	fare = float(fare)
After (Vectorized cleaning):
df['Fare'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Fare'], errors='coerce')

  Optimization Decisions Explained
According to Advanced (2024) and LinkedIn Insights (2023), the most effective RPA performance enhancements involve:
Replacing loops with vectorized operations for memory and speed gains
Using ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel I/O-bound tasks (e.g., confirmation API)
Retry logic with tenacity to avoid script failure on transient errors
Manual garbage collection (gc.collect()) to release memory after large batch processing
 Monitoring with psutil and profiling with cProfile for runtime diagnostics
 Reflection
The most challenging part of this project was simulating an unstable production environment with incomplete, duplicated, or corrupted data then building a robust automation pipeline to survive it. This demanded not only good Python skills but also a design mindset from RPA workflow experts like those discussed in resources by Abdul-Wahid (2023) and Malik (2023).
GitHub Copilot was helpful in generating boilerplate code for data creation and scaffolding. For example, it quickly generated a loop to fill out Faker records and suggested basic exception wrappers. However, it often suggested suboptimal solutions like using for loops when vectorized pandas code was more efficient and failed to recognize complex validation cases. I stepped in to enforce better practices based on profiling data and real-world patterns from the reading materials.
This assignment solidified my understanding that debugging is not just fixing errors, but designing for failure and ensuring the script gracefully recovers or fails fast. Incorporating retries, logging, and memory profiling transformed a brittle script into a production-ready automation flow. It also taught me the critical role of test data quality and exception awareness in the early stages of RPA development.
